├── app.py                          # Main Flask application
├── requirements.txt                # Python dependencies
├── registrants.json               # Data storage (auto-managed)

## Usage

### Adding Registrants

1. Click "Add Registrant" in the navigation
2. Fill out the comprehensive form with:

- Personal details (name, roll number)
- Group and gender selection
- Contact information (email, phone)
- Payment details
- Parts availability (T-Shirt, Food, Gift) — selecting T-Shirt reveals a size selector
- T-Shirt size (XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL) when T-Shirt is selected
- Referral information

1. Registration ID is auto-generated based on group and gender
2. Data is immediately saved to disk

### Managing Registrants
 
- **View**: Click "View" to see the live verification page
- **Edit**: Modify any registrant details, including revocation status
- **Delete**: Remove registrants with confirmation prompts
- **Statistics**: Monitor real-time dashboard statistics

### Data Format

Each registrant contains:

```json
{
  "name": "Student Name",
  "roll": "1202425010276",
  "gender": "Male",
  "registration_date": "11 September 2025",
  "registration_id": "SC-B-0001",
  "photo": "",
  "revoked": false,
  "referred_by": "",
  "paid": 1200,
  "email": "student@example.com",
  "phone": "01XXXXXXXXX",
  "parts_available": ["T-Shirt", "Food", "Gift"],
  "tshirt_size": "M"
}
```

## Integration

This management UI integrates seamlessly with the existing verification system:


- **Shared Data**: Uses the same `registrants.json` file as `generate_verifications.py`
- **Compatible URLs**: Verification links use the same ID-to-filename conversion
- **Consistent Structure**: Maintains all existing data fields and formats

## Development

The application is built with:

- **Backend**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Data Storage**: JSON file for simplicity and compatibility
- **Templating**: Jinja2 for dynamic content

## Security Notes

- This is a development server - use a production WSGI server for deployment
- The application handles form validation and data sanitization
- File operations include error handling and rollback capabilities

Built with ❤️ for Chayannito 26

Notes:

- When generating the master verified list, the "Referred By" column will attempt to resolve the value by registration ID, roll, or name and link to the referer's page. If no matching registrant is found, the original text is shown as plain text (no hyperlink). If the field is empty, an em-dash (—) will be displayed.
